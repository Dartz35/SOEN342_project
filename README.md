## How to Run

1. Compile and run:

   java Main

2. Input one of the following attribute:
 - from       
 - to         
 - departure  
 - arrival    
 - duration   
 - First Rate      
 - Second Rate      
 - Train type
 - Day of operation

3. Let's you choose 'to'. You will then input a value. (Consult eu_rail_network.csv file)
   Example: 'Aarhus'

Results:
Trip{id='D:R01613', Malmö?Aarhus, legs=1, dep=19:35, arr=04:50, dur=555min, changeTime=0min, First Rate=246.0?, Second Rate=134.0?, TrainTypes=[Nightjet], DaysOfOp=[Fri, Mon, Wed]}
Trip{id='D:R01614', Malmö?Aarhus, legs=1, dep=15:35, arr=18:00, dur=145min, changeTime=0min, First Rate=79.0?, Second Rate=49.0?, TrainTypes=[Frecciarossa], DaysOfOp=[Daily]}

5. Once you get the results, you will be prompted to either 'Sort' or 'Quit'. If you choose 'Sort', you will have the following choices:
Sort by: 
 1) Departure time
 2) Arrival time
 3) Origin city (A?Z)
 4) Destination city (A?Z)
 5) Duration
 6) First Rate
 7) Second Rate
Choose 1-7:

6. Let's say you choose '2'. You will now be prompted to display in either ascending or descending order.
   Order [A]sc / [D]esc (default A): 

7. Let's suppose you choose 'A'.

Results:
Trip{id='D:R01613', Malmö?Aarhus, legs=1, dep=19:35, arr=04:50, dur=555min, changeTime=0min, First Rate=246.0?, Second Rate=134.0?, TrainTypes=[Nightjet], DaysOfOp=[Fri, Mon, Wed]}
Trip{id='D:R01614', Malmö?Aarhus, legs=1, dep=15:35, arr=18:00, dur=145min, changeTime=0min, First Rate=79.0?, Second Rate=49.0?, TrainTypes=[Frecciarossa], DaysOfOp=[Daily]}

## How to Run

**1 - Compile and run**

   java Main

**2 - Choose an Attribute to Filter**

Console: 

You can input one of the following attributes:
 - from       
 - to         
 - departure  
 - arrival    
 - duration   
 - First Rate      
 - Second Rate      
 - Train type
 - Day of operation



At this step, the program asks you to filter trips by a specific attribute such as origin, destination, or train type.

You will be prompted to enter:

The attribute name (for example: from)

The value to search for (for example: Milan)



So you type:

Attribute: from

Value: Milan



Example output:

Results (4):
 1) Trip{id='D:R01694', Milan→Bergamo, dep=09:25, arr=11:32, First Rate=53.0€, Second Rate=38.0€}
 2) Trip{id='D:R01703', Milan→Rome, dep=05:45, arr=11:31, First Rate=122.0€, Second Rate=77.0€}
 3) Trip{id='D:R01705', Milan→Turin, dep=12:45, arr=14:43, First Rate=65.0€, Second Rate=42.0€}
 4) Trip{id='D:R01713', Milan→Zurich, dep=17:05, arr=22:22, First Rate=169.0€, Second Rate=106.0€}


Options: Search, Sort, Select, Book, ViewTrips, or Quit





**Step 3 – Select a Trip**

To choose a trip, type Select and then enter the Trip ID shown in the results.

> Select
Enter Trip ID (e.g., R02058): R02604


Output:

Selected Trip Details:
Trip{id='D:R02604', Strasbourg→Paris, dep=11:20, arr=12:50, dur=90min, First Rate=61.0€, Second Rate=39.0€, TrainTypes=[EuroCity], DaysOfOp=[Daily]}
Trip D:R02604 selected.




**Step 4 – Book the Trip**

After selecting a trip, type Book to start booking.

> Book
